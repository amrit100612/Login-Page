# 🌟 Latest Web Project Design 🌟

Welcome to this modern and stylish web project! This project is built using basic web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — to create a beautiful, functional webpage that works well on all devices. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this project is easy to understand and customize.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 💻 **Responsive and Mobile-Friendly:** The layout adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes, making it accessible from phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops without losing quality or usability.
- 🎨 **Custom Styling with CSS:** Carefully crafted styles enhance the visual appeal using colors, fonts, spacing, and layout techniques to create a clean and modern look.
- ⚡ **Dynamic Interactions with JavaScript:** The JavaScript code adds interactive elements like buttons, toggles, or animations that respond to user actions, making the webpage engaging and fun.
- 🌙 **Dark and Light Mode Support:** Users can switch between light and dark themes to improve readability and reduce eye strain based on their environment or preference.
- 🛠️ **Simple and Easy to Modify:** The project files are organized logically with clear and commented code, making it straightforward to tweak and extend the functionality and design.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `index.html`  
  This is the main HTML file that sets up the webpage's structure. It contains the elements such as header, main content, buttons, and footer.

- `style.css`  
  Here you will find all the CSS rules that style the page — controlling colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness, including styles for both dark and light modes.

- `script.js`  
  This JavaScript file adds the interactive capabilities — like switching themes, handling button clicks, or any animations to enhance user experience.
